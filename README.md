Hello all,

My name is Alejandro and here you can find the code exercise resolved as I understood. I try to do in the simplest way possible covering all the possible cases. Always using good practices focusing on clean code, OO design and TTD.

In the ScoreBoardService you can find the implementation of all operation describes in the execise. And in WorldCupApp you can execute the application printing the result as was describled also in the exercise file.

I hope you like it :)

Alejandro,

Regards
